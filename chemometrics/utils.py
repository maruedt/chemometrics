def generate_spectra(n_wl, n_band, bandwidth):
    r"""
    Generate a dummy spectra with n_band

    A dummy spectra is generated based on a given number of peaks. The
    bandwidth, location and height is selected randomly. The center of each
    peak follows a uniform distribution over the range of the spectra.
    Each peaks bandwidth is drawn from a gamma distribution. The gamma
    distribution has a heavy tail resulting in the generation of (also) broad
    peaks. The peak height is Poisson distributed with a mean height of 5. Each
    peak in the artificial spectrum follows a Gaussian shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_wl : int
        number of wavelengths/signals to generate
    n_band : int
        number of bands to generate
    bandwidth : float
        impacts the bandwidth of each band.

    Returns
    -------
    spectra : ndarray (n_wl, )
        artificial spectra

def generate_background(n_wl, rel_lengthscale=0.5, size=1):

    Generate dummy background.

    Generate dummy background by drawing samples from a gaussian process.

    Parameters
    ----------

        number of wavelengths/signals to generate
    rel_lengthscale : float
        lengths scale of the gaussian process kernel

    Generate artificial spectroscopic XY data without background

    An artificial spectroscopic dataset is generated, which resembles a Raman,
