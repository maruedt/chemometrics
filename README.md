# chemometrics
chemometrics is a free and open source chemometrics package for Python. Its main focus lies on spectroscopic data (e.g. UV/Vis, NIR, Raman, NMR and MS). chemometrics integrates with the scikit-learn library for machine learning. The package provides methods for plotting, preprocessing, factorizing, and fitting data. The source code is available from: https://github.com/maruedt/chemometrics
