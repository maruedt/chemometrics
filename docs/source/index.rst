Welcome!
========

**chemometrics** is a free and open source chemometric library for Python. Its
main focus lies on the chemometric analysis of spectroscopic data (e.g.
UV/Vis, NIR, Raman, NMR and MS). chemometrics builds on scikit-learn and
extends its functionalities to support chemometric data analysis. The package
provides methods for plotting, preprocessing and fitting data. In contrast to
scikit-learn, chemometrics is mainly intended for interactive work.


.. note::

  chemometrics is work in progress. The API might still change from one release to the next.
