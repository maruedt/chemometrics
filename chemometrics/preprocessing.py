def asym_ls(X, y, asym_factor=0.1):
    r"""
    Perform an asymmetric least squares regression.

    A linear regression is performed where either negative (default) or
    positive residuals are more strongly penalized.
    `asym_factor` defines the asymmetry of the regression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : (n, m) ndarray
        coefficient matrix
    y : {(n,) ndarray, (n, o) ndarray}
        dependent variables

    Returns
    -------
    beta : (m, o) ndarray
        regression coefficients

    Notes
    -----
    Following equation is solved:

    .. math:: \hat{\beta} = \argmin_\beta (w(y-Xb))^2

    with :math:`w` being a diagonal matrix of weights.
    If :math:`(y-Xb)>0: w_{ii}=asym_factor`
    otherwise :math:`w_{ii} = 1 - asym_factor`

    The problem is solved by iteratively adjusting :math:`w` and using a normal
    least-squares regression [1]. The alogrithm stops as soon as the weights
    are not adjusted from the previous cycle.

def emsc(D, p_order=2, background=None, normalize=False, algorithm='als',
         **kwargs):
    r"""
    Perform extended multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC) on `D`

    `emsc` is a spectral pretreatment which is based on a linear decomposition
    of data into baseline contributions and chemical information. Baseline
    contributions are modelled by polynomial terms up to order `p_order`. The
    chemical information is summarized by the mean spectrum orthogonalized to
    the baseline terms. `emsc` additionally provides a the functionality for
    orthogonalizing spectra with respect to background information and for
    normalizing the returned spectra.

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : (n, m) ndarray
        Data to be pretreated. ``n`` samples x ``m`` variables (typically
        wavelengths)
    p_order : int
        Polynoms up to order `p_order` are included for baseline subtraction.
    background : {None (default), (m, o) ndarray}
        Perform additional orthogonalization with respect to background. If
        ``None`` omitted. Otherwise, ``m`` variables x ``o`` background spectra
    normalize : {False (default), True}
        Perform normalization of results
    algorithm : {'als' (default)}
        choice of algorithms for regression. Currently, only asymmetric least
        squares is supported

    Returns
    -------
    D_pretreated : (n, m) ndarray
        Pretreated data.
    coefficients : (n, k) ndarray
        Coefficient matrix summarizing regression coefficients of EMSC.

def whittaker(X, penalty, constraint_order=2):
    r"""
    Smooth `X` with a whittaker smoother

    `whittaker` smooths `X` with a whittaker smoother. The smoother smooths
    the data with a non-parametric line constraint by its second derivative
    smoothness. `penalty` defines the penalty on non-smoothness.
    The whittaker smoother is very efficient and a useful drop-in replacement
    for Savitzky-Golay smoothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : (n, m) ndarray
        Matrix containing data series to smooth. The function expects. ``n``
        datapoints in ``m``series.
    penalty : float
        scaling factor of the penality term for non-smoothness
    constraint_order : int
        defines on which order of derivative the constraint acts on.

    Returns
    -------
    smoothed : (n, m) ndarray
        Smoothed `X`

    Notes
    -----
    `whittaker` uses a sparse matrices for efficiency reasons. `X` may
    however be a full matrix.
    In contrast to the proposed algorithm by Eilers [1], no Cholesky
    decomposition is used. The reason is twofold. The Cholesky decomposition
    is not implemented for sparse matrices in Numpy/Scipy. Eilers uses the
    Cholesky decomposition to prevent Matlab from "reordering the sparse
    equation systems for minimal bandwidth". Matlab seems to rely on UMFPACK
    for sparse matrix devision [2] which implements column reordering for
    sparsity preservation. As sparse matrix we are working with is square and
    positive-definite, we can rely on the builtin `factorize` method, which
    solves with UMFPACK if installed, otherwise with SuperLU.
