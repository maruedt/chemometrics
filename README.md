# chemometrics

**chemometrics** is a free and open source library for visualization, modeling, and prediction of multivariate data.

The package streamlines chemometric workflows by providing powerful preprocessing algorithms combined with simple
functional calls for generating fully calibrated chemometric models. A variety of analytical visualizations help to
understand the data and build trust into the generated models. Looking for further extending the models? chemometrics is
fully compatible with scikit-learn. Use advanced machine learning algorithms to get most out of your data.

The documentation is hosted at https://chemometrics.readthedocs.io

## Installation
chemometrics is distributed over PyPI. The simplest way to install chemometrics is by running

```
python -m pip install chemometrics
```

## Example applications

Plotting with reference coloring:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import chemometrics as cm

plt.figure(figsize=[12, 5])
lines = cm.plot_colored_series(D.T, x=wavenumbers, reference=C[:, 1])
plt.xlabel(r'Wavenumber / $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$')
plt.ylabel('Intensity / AU')
```

Preprocessing by smoothing and performing a second derivative:
```python
X_deriv = cm.Whittaker(constraint_order=3, deriv=2).fit_transform(X)
cm.plot_colored_series(X_deriv.T, reference=Y)
plt.xlabel('Wavenumber / nm')
plt.ylabel('$d^2A/dl^2$ / $mAU/nm^2$')
```
![derived spectra](docs/source/examples/peaches_deriv.png "Second derivative NIR spectra")


A working PLS model is just one function call away:
```python
cm.fit_pls(X_deriv, Y)
```
