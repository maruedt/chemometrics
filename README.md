# chemometrics
chemometrics is a free and open source chemometrics package for Python. Its main focus lies on the chemometric analysis of spectroscopic data (e.g. UV/Vis, NIR, Raman, NMR and MS). chemometrics integrates with the scikit-learn library for machine learning. The package provides methods for plotting, preprocessing and fitting data. chemometrics is intended for interactive work and provides some summary statistics. The source code is available from: https://github.com/maruedt/chemometrics

## Example applications
Examples are shown in the examples folder. For an initial overview of a typical regression workflow, a look at [this example](https://github.com/maruedt/chemometrics/blob/master/examples/basic_pls_example.ipynb) might be most interesting.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.8
- Numpy >= 1.19.2
- Scipy >= 1.5.2
- scikit-learn >= 0.23.2
- matplotlib >= 3.3.2

Earlier versions of the required libraries may work but have not been tested.

## Nomenclature
chemometrics generally complies with the glossary of scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html
