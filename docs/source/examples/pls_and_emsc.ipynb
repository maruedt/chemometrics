    "For this example, synthetic spectral data is used. The synthetic spectra must be rather complex to demonstrate the benefits of the EMSC preprocessing. EMSC is especially powerful if spectra are corrupted by known background signals which are orthogonal to the target signal but display a similar bandwidth.\n",

    "We will use an artificial background composed of four contributions. 1) and 2): Two correlated background chemicals with sharp features which mask the target component spectra. 3) One slower varying broadband contaminating signal is added for additional complexity. 4) Furthermore, we also include Gaussian noise in the background. To generate said signals, we rely on support functions which chemometrics provides. `generate_background` uses a Gaussian process to generate a slowly varying background. `generate_spectra` distributes Gaussian peaks with random width and height over the baseline.\n",

If looking at the predictors around 400, a new peak is visible in the data which was not present in the background spectra. Otherwise, no other additional peaks are apparent. This is also the intention of this example. If looking at the parameter for the artificial dataset, the standard deviation `noise` of the measurement noise (component 4) was set to 0.2. The background chemical signals vary between 0 and 1. The signal of the target component has a maximum height 10 times smaller than the background.

    "The `Emsc` object in chemometrics provides the functionality of removing slowely varying background signals. Furthermore, the object also provides functionality for orthognalizing spectra with respect to a background signal. To understand this functionality, a quick overview of the inner workings of the `Emsc` is given.\n",

    "The somewhat surprising approach of the EMSC is now to actually remove all variation by the polynomial contributions and just retain the scaled average spectra *and* the residuals. The approach is easily extended to remove additional components by just adding additional vectors to the linear fit. The number of components provided to the EMSC has to be limited to prevent an amplification of noise.\n",

    "In our case, we will use the 50 background spectra to provide an insight into the interferring chemical components and background shift. We will also use a Whittaker filter to remove noise from the spectra (for details on the Whittaker filter, refer to the corresponding documentation and [this example](https://github.com/maruedt/chemometrics/blob/master/examples/whittaker.ipynb)). First, it may be worth to just get a general impression of the trends in the dataset. The function `plot_svd` plots the singular vectors and singular values of a dataset. It is comparable to a PCA except that the data is not mean centered and the scale of the variation is captured by the singular values (not in the scores as for the PCA). The functionalities of `Whittaker` and `plot_svd` are simply chained."
