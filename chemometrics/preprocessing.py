def asym_ls(X, y, asym_factor=0.1):
    r"""
    Perform an asymmetric least squares regression.

    A linear regression is performed where either negative (default) or
    positive residuals are more strongly penalized.
    `asym_factor` defines the asymmetry of the regression.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : (n, m) ndarray
        coefficient matrix
    y : {(n,) ndarray, (n, o) ndarray}
        dependent variables

    Returns
    -------
    beta : (m, o) ndarray
        regression coefficients

    Notes
    -----
    Following equation is solved:

    .. math:: \hat{\beta} = \argmin_\beta (w(y-Xb))^2

    with :math:`w` being a diagonal matrix of weights.
    If :math:`(y-Xb)>0: w_{ii}=asym_factor`
    otherwise :math:`w_{ii} = 1 - asym_factor`

    The problem is solved by iteratively adjusting :math:`w` and using a normal
    least-squares regression [1]. The alogrithm stops as soon as the weights
    are not adjusted from the previous cycle or the maximum number of cycles are
    exceeded.

class Emsc(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):

    `Emsc` is a spectral pretreatment which is based on a linear decomposition

    contributions are modelled by polynomial terms up to order `p_order`. The
    chemical information is summarized by the mean spectrum orthogonalized to
    the baseline terms. `Emsc` additionally provides a the functionality for
    orthogonalizing spectra with respect to background information and for
    normalizing the returned spectra.

    Parameters

    p_order : int
        Polynoms up to order `p_order` are included for baseline subtraction.

        ``None`` omitted. Otherwise, ``m`` variables x ``o`` background spectra

    algorithm : {'als' (default)}
        choice of algorithms for regression. Currently, only asymmetric least
        squares is supported

    Attributes
    ----------
    regressor_ : array of floats

class Whittaker(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):

    Smooth `X` with a whittaker smoother

    `whittaker` smooths `X` with a whittaker smoother. The smoother smooths
    the data with a non-parametric line constraint by its derivative
    smoothness. `penalty` defines the penalty on non-smoothness.
    The whittaker smoother is very efficient and a useful drop-in replacement
    for Savitzky-Golay smoothing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    penalty : float or 'auto' (default)
        Scaling factor of the penalty term for non-smoothness. If 'auto' is
        given, a penalty is estimated based on an algorithmically optimized
        leave-one-out cross validation

    constraint_order : int
        Defines on which order of derivative the constraint acts on.

    deriv : int
        Derivative of the data. Default: 0 - no derivative. Note: deriv should
        always be <= constraint_order.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimate_penalty : boolean
        `True` if penalty is estimated.

    penalty_ : float
        The applied penalty for smoothing.

    solve1d_ : function
        Solver for smoothing of 1D vector

    Notes
    -----
    `Whittaker` uses a sparse matrices for efficiency reasons. `X` may
    however be a full matrix.
    In contrast to the proposed algorithm by Eilers [1], no Cholesky
    decomposition is used. The reason is twofold. The Cholesky decomposition
    is not implemented for sparse matrices in Numpy/Scipy. Eilers uses the
    Cholesky decomposition to prevent Matlab from "reordering the sparse
    equation systems for minimal bandwidth". Matlab seems to rely on UMFPACK
    for sparse matrix devision [2] which implements column reordering for
    sparsity preservation. As sparse matrix we are working with is square and
    positive-definite, we can rely on the builtin `factorize` method, which
    solves with UMFPACK if installed, otherwise with SuperLU.

    Derivatives are implemented by multiplying the smoothed matrix with a
    (local) difference matrix. This is not explicitly described in [1].
    However, the approach is consistent with the underlying idea of the
    Whittaker smoother as the (local) differences are used in the derivation of
    the filter. Note: the derivative should always be smaller equal to the
    constraint order. This is, since the Whittaker filter won't explizitly
    penaltize higher derivative fluctuations than the constraint order.
